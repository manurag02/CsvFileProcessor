# CsvFileProcessor
Please use attached Postman collection for testing the api.
Documentation can be found at `http://localhost:8080/csvfileprocessor/swagger-ui/index.html#/`

Parts that could have been done when given sufficient time :-
1. TDD approach 
2. Security - at least basic authentication and role based authentication for deleting all the records
3. Logging
4. Better Exception handling as I have used basic classes

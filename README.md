# CsvFileProcessor
Please use attached Postman collection for testing the api.\
Please use mvn clean install to after cloning the project and mvn spring-boot:run to run the application.\
Documentation can be found at `http://localhost:8080/csvfileprocessor/swagger-ui/index.html#/`.

Parts that could have been done when given sufficient time :-
1. TDD approach 
2. Security - at least basic authentication and role based authentication for deleting all the records
3. Logging
4. Better Exception handling as I have used basic classes
5. Dockerization of the application 

Note: I have committed to this code base after the Deadline as well as I found the task interesting. Please take the commit of 15th Jan for reference. Thank you.
